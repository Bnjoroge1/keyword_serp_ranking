# keyword_serp_ranking

Two seperate tools, both using the Value SERP API to fetch relevant ranking data

#Keyword SERP Scraping
First tool is a keyword ranking tool, where a user inputs a keyword or keywords, and then the SERP is returned, providing a CSV export of titles & URLs.
User has to provide a keyword/s, the Google domain that they'd like to use, the language of the SERP, and the region of the search

#People Also Ask Scraping
The second tool is a People Also Ask scraping tool, that takes a user input of keywords, and then returns relevant PAA (inlcuding URL, questions & answers)
There's been additional functionality added:

1. Ability to test more than a single keyword
2. Option to download the data as a csv file
3. Option to upload a CSV file
4. Added a limit to upload to a maximum of 100 keywords


There's a couple of things that I'd like to add soon:
1. Batch API usage for over 10 keywords
2. User logins
3. User passwords 
4. Analytics implementation (in a sheet)
5. User Analytics Dashboard (anonymised)
6. Add link to ko-fi (or similar)
7.
